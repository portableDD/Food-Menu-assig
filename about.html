        <h1>About us</h1> 
        <h2><strong>Welcome to Fusion Station!</strong> </h2> 
        <p>At Fusion Station, we're passionate about serving up delicious, authentic cuisine that brings people together. Our story began with a simple idea: to share the flavors and traditions of our family's kitchen with our community.</p>

        <h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Our restaurant was founded by Ayodele Jacob, who grew up cooking alongside their family and learning the secrets of traditional intercontinental and local cuisine. With a dream of sharing these flavors with others, Ayodele Jacob opened our doors in 2015 and has been serving up love and laughter ever since.
        </p>
